    <h4>What is a negawatt?</h4>
    <p>For this application, a negawatt is defined as one watt of power avoided or saved from use on the energy grid due to energy efficiency.</p>
    <h4>How are the negawatt savings are calculated?</h4>
    <p>The amount of negawatts each rebate generates is determined by taking the difference of two averages for each appliance category.  The first average is the yearly electrical consumption of several energy star models and the second is the average yearly electrical consumption of several non-energy star models.  The amount of energy saved is also displayed as a monetary value.  This estimated value is calculated using the current kilowatt cost and the estimated total amount of negawatts generated.</p>
